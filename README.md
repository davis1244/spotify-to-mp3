# spotify-to-mp3
This Python app lets users download Spotify playlists as MP3s to their desktop. It uses Spotipy for Spotify API access, yt-dlp to download and convert tracks from YouTube, and tkinter for a simple GUI. Users input playlist names, and the app downloads the tracks into a designated folder on their desktop.
